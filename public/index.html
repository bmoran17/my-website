    <h1>Brenda Moran</h1>
    <h2>From Teacher to Software Engineer</h2>
    <p>I have gone from pursuing a teaching credential to learning how to code and changing career paths.
        What started as just learning a new skill became my new driving force. I'm passionate about 
        learning new things and teaching them, solving problems, and creating things.
        
        Currently, I am waiting to start my (second) bachelor's in computer science. Before that I self-taught 
        myself a couple programming languages such as Python and Javscript. I have taken college courses and 
        also learned about C++ and a bit of MIPS assembly language.
        
        In my spare time, I'm usually watching soap operas (telenovelas), catching up on a new book, doing
        some photography or hanging around with my two cats.
